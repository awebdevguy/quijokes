# QUIJOKES

https://awebdevguy.github.io/quijokes

A web app with a robot that tells random tacky jokes.

The jokes are grabbed by using a joke api.

It then uses the system's voice synthesis to tell the joke.

The jokes have captions as on some tablets 
the voice synthesis does not work, both ios and android systems.
